# Running lucid-sonic-dreams on google colab
Contains custom code with working jupyter notebook to run lucid-sonic-dreams inside google colab.
All older notebooks of lucid-sonic-dreams online don't work anymore on google colab because it stopped supporting older versions of tensorflow and other issues.
I managed to get it working again with a workaround of creating a conda env inside of the google colab with the necessary versions of python and libraries.
