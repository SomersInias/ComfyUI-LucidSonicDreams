# Running lucid-sonic-dreams on google colab
Contains custom code with working jupyter notebook to run lucid-sonic-dreams inside google colab. 

Most (Or all) older notebooks of lucid-sonic-dreams online don't work anymore on google colab because it stopped supporting older versions of tensorflow and some other issues that I have encountered. 

I managed to get it working again with a workaround of creating a conda env inside of the google colab with the necessary versions of python and libraries.
